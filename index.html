                            For over 700 years, the Ancestral Pueblo people
                            built thriving communities on the mesas and in the
                            cliffs of Mesa Verde. Today, the park protects the
                            rich cultural heritage of 26 Pueblos and Tribes and
                            offers visitors a spectacular window into the past.
                            This World Heritage Site and International Dark Sky
                            Park is home to over a thousand species, including
                            several that live nowhere else on earth.
                        </p>
                        <p class="responsive-center">
                            The Ancestral Puebloans lived in Mesa Verde until
                            around 1300 AD. But after building a whole
                            civilisation in the cliffs, one day they just upped
                            and left. The biggest mystery of Mesa Verde is what
                            happened to them, and because there are no written
                            records from the time weâ€™ll never really know. But
                            itâ€™s thought a mix of drought, deforestation and
                            overhunting mixed with a booming population meant
                            they were forced to migrate south to find food.
